## {{page.title}}

There are 3 different modes of persistence:

* Journaling
* SnapshotPerTransaction
* ManualSnaphots

## Journaling
This is the default. Each command is written to the journal before execution.

## SnapshotPerTransaction
Writes a snapshot after every successful command. No journaling.

## Manual snapshots
No journaling. Nothing is saved until Engine.CreateSnaphot() is called or if
SnapshotBehavior is set to either AfterRestore or OnShutdown

## Example

{% highlight csharp %}
   var config = EngineConfiguration.Create();
   config.PersistenceMode = PersistenceMode.SnapshotPerTransaction;
   
   var db = Engine.For<MyModel>(config);

{% endhighlight %}
