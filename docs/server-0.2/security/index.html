<h1>Security</h1>
<p>
	Almost none. The web based ui is password protected. Other than that there is no authentication, encryption or authorization on any of the interfaces. Act accordingly. Only expose interfaces to trusted clients.
<h2>Password</h2>
<p>
	The web ui password hash is stored in the server config db. There is no way to retrieve a lost password
	but there is a procedure to clear the password allowing a new one to be created.
