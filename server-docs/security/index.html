<h1>Security</h1>
<p>
	Almost none. The web based ui is password protected. Other than that there is no authentication, 
	encryption or authorization on any of the interfaces. Act accordingly.
</p>
<h2>Password</h2>
<p>
	The web ui password hash is stored in the server config db. There is no way to retrieve a lost password
	but there is a procedure to clear the password allowing a new one to be created.
</p>
<h2>Engine Authorization</h2>
<p>
	The engine will pick up the identity of the currently running thread and authorize against a set of rules with a
	default of ALLOW for all requests. This behavior can be customized (programming required).
	However, all the server threads have the same identity as the server process so there is no point in doing so yet.
	This might change in a future version.
