{"name":"Devrex Labs","tagline":"Building OrigoDB","body":"# What is OrigoDB?\r\nOrigoDB is an in-memory database platform. The engine is 100% ACID, runs in-process and hosts a user defined data model. The data model can be domain specific or generic and is defined using plain old NET types. Persistence is achieved snapshots and write-ahead command logging to the underlying storage.\r\n\r\nOur design goals focus around rapid development, testability, simplicity, correctness, modularity, flexibility and extensibility. Performance was never a goal but OrigoDB easily outperforms disk oriented systems. Yet there is room for significant performance optimizations.\r\n \r\n## Example using a proxy\r\nThis is based on the twitter clone example in the http://github.com/devrexlabs/OrigoDb.Examples repository.\r\n```\r\ninstall-package origodb.core\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n   var db = Db.For<TwitterVerse>(\"mode=embedded\");\r\n   db.AddUser(\"beavis\");\r\n   var id = db.Tweet(\"beavis\", \"I need TP for my bunghole\", DateTime.Now);\r\n   db.Favorite(\"beavis\", id);\r\n   db.Follow(\"beavis\", \"butthead\");\r\n   db.Favorite(\"butthead\", id);\r\n```\r\nThe method calls are transparently intercepted by the proxy, mapped to command objects\r\nand persisted to the command journal.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n* Core documentation - http://github.com/devrexlabs/origodb/wiki/documentation\r\n* http://origodb.com/ - Commercial site offering OrigoDB Server including enterprise features and support.\r\n* http://geekstream.devrexlabs.com - tech blog search demo built with OrigoDB\r\n* http://livedb.devrex.se/ - Old blog\r\n* http://robertfriberg.se/ - New blog\r\n* http://twitter.com/devrexlabs - announcements\r\n* http://twitter.com/robertfriberg - rants\r\n* @devrexlabs - Github organisation page\r\n* http://eepurl.com/OGGHz - monthly newsletter\r\n* http://groups.google.com/origodb - The mailing list for discussions and support\r\n* http://www.nuget.org/packages/OrigoDB.Core/\r\n* http://nuget.org/packages?q=origodb&sortOrder=package-download-count - Nuget packages\r\n* todo - Binary downloads\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
